The concept of 3D printing dates back to the early 1980s when Charles W. Hull, commonly known as Chuck Hull, invented stereolithography (SLA), the first commercial 3D printing technology. This groundbreaking innovation allowed for the creation of complex structures layer by layer, revolutionizing the manufacturing industry. Hull's invention paved the way for the development of various other 3D printing technologies that would follow.

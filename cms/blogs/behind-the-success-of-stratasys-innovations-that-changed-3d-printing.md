At DMI3D, we've always been inspired by pioneers who redefine the boundaries of technology and innovation. One such trailblazer in the realm of additive manufacturing is Stratasys. Founded in 1989, Stratasys has not only been at the forefront of 3D printing technology but has also set benchmarks that have propelled the entire industry forward. In this article, we delve into the groundbreaking innovations by Stratasys that have transformed 3D printing, shaping it into a vital tool across diverse industries from aerospace to healthcare.

Stratasys’ journey from a small startup to a global leader in 3D printing is a testament to the power of vision coupled with relentless innovation. As we explore their path, we'll uncover how their pioneering technologies, such as Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), PolyJet, and Stereolithography (SLA), have not only enhanced production capabilities but also opened new avenues for designers and manufacturers worldwide.



### The Origins of Stratasys

Stratasys, a name synonymous with innovation in 3D printing, was founded in 1989 by Scott Crump and his wife Lisa Crump in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, USA. The inception of Stratasys was marked by Scott Crump's groundbreaking invention of Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) technology, which revolutionized the way objects could be built layer by layer from thermoplastics.

#### The Birth of FDM Technology

The story of FDM began one night at the Crump family kitchen table, where Scott Crump, a mechanical engineer, was trying to create a toy frog for his young daughter using a glue gun loaded with a mixture of polyethylene and candle wax. The idea was simple yet revolutionary—extruding and layering materials to build three-dimensional objects. This experiment laid the foundation for what would become Fused Deposition Modeling. Over the next few years, Scott Crump refined the technology, filed for a patent in 1989, and officially formed Stratasys Ltd. The patent was granted in 1992, solidifying FDM as a cornerstone of modern 3D printing.

#### Early Challenges and Innovations

The early days of Stratasys were focused on overcoming the technical challenges associated with making FDM a reliable and marketable technology. Stratasys’ first product, the 3D Modeler, was launched in 1992. It was primarily aimed at prototyping and low-volume manufacturing, offering businesses a faster and more cost-effective way to develop product prototypes than traditional methods.

#### Expanding the Reach and Capabilities

As the adoption of FDM grew, Stratasys continued to innovate. They expanded their material capabilities to include a range of thermoplastics, which opened up new applications in automotive, aerospace, and medical industries. The versatility and reliability of FDM helped establish Stratasys as a leader in the field of additive manufacturing.

#### Public Offering and Growth

In 1994, Stratasys made its initial public offering (IPO) on the NASDAQ, which provided the capital needed to accelerate research and development and expand its market presence. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Stratasys continued to grow, both organically and through strategic acquisitions, including the merger with Objet Ltd. in 2012, which added PolyJet technology to its portfolio.

Stratasys’ journey from a simple idea at a kitchen table to a multinational corporation underscores the transformative power of innovation and persistence. Today, Stratasys remains at the forefront of 3D printing technology, constantly pushing the boundaries of what additive manufacturing can achieve.



### Pioneering Technologies Developed by Stratasys

Stratasys, a titan in the 3D printing industry, has carved its niche through continuous innovation and the development of groundbreaking technologies. Let's explore three of Stratasys' core technologies: Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), PolyJet, and Stereolithography (SLA), which have played pivotal roles in transforming the landscape of 3D printing across various sectors.

#### Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)

FDM technology, which Stratasys commercialized in the early 1990s, works by extruding thermoplastic filaments through a heated nozzle, layer by layer, to build durable and functional parts. This technology is celebrated for its robustness, ability to produce complex geometries, and suitability for a variety of engineering-grade materials such as ABS, PC, and ULTEM™. FDM is widely used in automotive, aerospace, and consumer goods industries for applications ranging from prototyping to end-use part production.

#### PolyJet Technology

PolyJet is another revolutionary technology from Stratasys that offers unprecedented detail, precision, and material versatility. This technology works by jetting layers of curable liquid photopolymer onto a build tray. Each photopolymer layer is instantly cured by UV light, allowing for the construction of parts with complex geometries and intricate details. PolyJet is particularly valued in industries such as dental and medical for creating models, prototypes, and parts that require fine features and diverse material properties including rigidity, transparency, and flexibility.

#### Stereolithography (SLA)

Stratasys also harnesses SLA technology, which is ideal for creating highly accurate and smooth-surfaced prototypes by curing layers of resin with an ultraviolet laser. SLA is commonly used for producing large concept models, functional prototypes, and investment casting patterns. It is especially beneficial in the medical and dental fields for creating patient-specific replicas and devices.

These core technologies underline Stratasys' commitment to innovation and their ability to stay ahead of industry demands. By continuously advancing these technologies, Stratasys not only enhances their own product offerings but also empowers businesses across the globe to push the boundaries of what's possible in additive manufacturing.
